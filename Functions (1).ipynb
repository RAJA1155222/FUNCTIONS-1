        "\n",
        "Lambda functions are typically used in situations where a small, one-time function is needed, and defining a full function using def would be overkill. Here are some common use cases:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Short and Simple Operations: When you need a function for a simple operation that can be expressed in a single expression, such as squaring a number, adding two numbers, or filtering a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Higher-Order Functions: Lambda functions are often used as arguments to higher-order functions like map, filter, and reduce. These functions take a function as an argument and apply it to a sequence of elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Callbacks and Event Handlers: In some cases, you might need to define a function that will be called later in response to an event. Lambda functions can be used for this purpose, as they provide a concise way to define a function without giving it a separate name.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Creating Closures: Lambda functions can be used to create closures, which are functions that \"remember\" the values of variables in their enclosing scope. This can be useful for creating functions with dynamic behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Advantages of Lambda Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Conciseness: They allow you to define functions in a single line of code, making your code more compact.\n",
        "- Readability: For simple operations, lambda functions can make your code easier to read by avoiding the need to define a separate function.\n",
        "- Flexibility: They can be used in a variety of situations, such as with higher-order functions and callbacks.\n",
        "#Limitations of Lambda Functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Single Expression: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression, which limits their complexity.\n",
        "- No Statements: They cannot contain statements like loops or conditional statements.\n",
        "-Debugging: Debugging lambda functions can be more challenging due to their anonymous nature."
